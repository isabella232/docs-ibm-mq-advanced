This documentation describes IBM MQ Advanced for Developers for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). IBM MQ Advanced for Developers 
for PCF enables users to deploy IBM MQ Queue Managers onto a Pivotal Container Service (PKS) environment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

This integration deploys a single IBM MQ Advanced for Developers server (Queue Manager). IBM MQ is messaging middleware that 
simplifies and accelerates the integration of diverse applications and business data across multiple platforms. It uses 
message queues to facilitate the exchanges of information and offers a single messaging solution for cloud, mobile, 
Internet of Things (IoT), and on-premises environments.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

IBM MQ Advanced for Developers for PCF will do the following:

* Create a single MQ server (Queue Manager) using a [StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) with exactly one replica.  Kubernetes will ensure that if it fails for some reason, it will be restarted, possibly on a different worker node.
* Create a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This is used to ensure that MQ client applications have a consistent IP address to connect to, regardless of where the Queue Manager is actually running.

+ 0.5 CPU core

+ 0.5 Gi memory

+ 2 Gi persistent volume

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

It is not generally recommended that you change the number of replicas in the StatefulSet from the default value of 1. Setting 
the number of replicas creates multiple Queue Managers.  The recommended way to scale MQ is by deploying this 
chart multiple times and connecting the Queue Managers together using MQ configuration — see [Architectures based on multiple 
queue managers](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pla.doc/q004720_.htm).  

If you choose 
to set a different number of replicas on the StatefulSet, connections to each Queue Manager will be routed via a single IP 
address from the Kubernetes Service.  Connections to multiple replicas via a Service are load balanced, typically on a round-robin 
basis.  If you do this, you need to take great care not to create an affinity between an MQ client and server, because a 
client might get disconnected, and then re-connect to a different server.  See Chapter 7 of the 
[IBM MQ as a Service Redpaper](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp5209.pdf)

It is not recommended to change the number of replicas in the StatefulSet after initial deployment.  This will cause the 
addition or deletion of Queue Managers, which can result in loss of messages.
