These are release notes for IBM MQ Advanced for Developers for PCF.

## <a id="ver"></a> v4.0.0

**Release Date:** July 1, 2019

Features included in this release:

* Create a single MQ server (Queue Manager) using a [StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) with exactly one replica.  Kubernetes will ensure that if it fails for some reason, it will be restarted, possibly on a different worker node.
* Create a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This is used to ensure that MQ client applications have a consistent IP address to connect to, regardless of where the Queue Manager is actually running.
